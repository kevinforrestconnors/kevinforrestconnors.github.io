      My interest in computers began at the age of five, playing <a href="http://celmin.pwcsite.com/strangegames/">Stardust</a> on my dad's Macintosh Performa.  At the age of 14, I started making algorithmic art in JavaScript.  Since then, I've dabbled in lots of different languages in every paradigm, and I really enjoy learning languages.

    <div class="p">
      I also like learning <span class="text-it">about</span> languages.  My fourth semester in college I took Intro to Linguistics and decided to minor in it.  In order to fulfill the elective requirements, I began taking advanced Spanish classes, culminating in 300 levels.  The combination of formal, mathematical language study (Computer Science), natural language study (Spanish), and the study of languages caused me to reconsider what a language <span class="text-it">is</span>.  Richard Montague once said, <span class="text-it">“I reject the contention that an important theoretical difference exists between formal and natural languages.”</span>  In other words, any natural language could, in theory, be described completely mathematically!
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      My coursework caused me to be interested bridging the conceptual gap between formal and natural languages.  This involves both improvements on programming languages and IDEs and also thinking about ways to improve natural language communication through technology.  Since communication is the end-all goal of language, I am also interested in accessibility and internationalization (we programmers are lazy and call these a11y and i18n).
