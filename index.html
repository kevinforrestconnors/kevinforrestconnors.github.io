        My interest in computers began at the age of five, playing <span class="text-it">Cro-Mag Rally</span> on my dad's Macintosh Performa.  At the age of 14, I started making algorithmic art in JavaScript.  Though JS may have been my high school sweetheart, I’ve realized that every language has its pros and cons and I still haven’t found my <span class="text-it">true</span> love - but I have no doubt that someday I’ll find the perfect language for me.

        My fourth semester in college I took Introduction to Linguistics and decided to minor in it.  In order to fulfill the elective requirements, I began taking advanced Spanish classes, culminating in 300 levels.  The combination of formal, mathematical language study (CS), natural language study (Spanish), and the study of languages caused me to reconsider what a language \textit{is}.  Richard Montague once said, “I reject the contention that an important theoretical difference exists between formal and natural languages.”  In other words, any natural language can be described completely with math!

        I’m interested in bridging the conceptual gap between formal and natural languages.  This involves both improvements on programming languages and IDEs and also studying ways to improve natural language.  Both fields have a lot to share with each other and right now, I’m focused on learning as much as I can about both theoretical and applied computer science and linguistics.
